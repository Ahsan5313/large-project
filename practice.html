	   knew why the sun rises in the east and sets in the west the boatman replied that he is merely 
	   a very simple boatman he did not know that much the scholar at this informed the boat man that
	   one fourth of his life was spoilt the boatman had nothing to say but stare at the scholar after 
	   a while the boatman politely replied that he had never studied any book let alone geography.
